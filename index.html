<p>Networks are getting larger and more complex; yet administrators
rely on rudimentary tools such as ping and tracer-
oute to debug problems. We propose an automated and systematic
approach for testing and debugging networks called
“Automatic Test Packet Generation” (ATPG). ATPG reads
router configurations and generates a device-independent model.
The model is used to generate a minimum set of test packets
to (minimally) exercise every link in the network or (maximally)
exercise every rule in the network. Test packets are
sent periodically and detected failures trigger a separate mechanism
to localize the fault. ATPG can detect both functional
(e.g., incorrect firewall rule) and performance problems
(e.g., congested queue). ATPG complements but goes
beyond earlier work in static checking (which cannot detect
liveness or performance faults) or fault localization (which
only localize faults given liveness results).</p>

<p>We describe our prototype ATPG implementation and results
on two real-world data sets: Stanford University’s backbone
network and Internet2. We find that a small number of
test packets suffices to test all rules in these networks: For
example 4000 packets can cover all rules in Stanford backbone
network while 54 is enough to cover all links. Sending
4000 test packets 10 times per second consumes lesss than
1% of link capacity. ATPG code and the data sets are publicly
available.</p>
